\section*{ER model for music database}

\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{er} % Example image
\end{center}
}
\section*{SQL DDL code for table creations}
\lstinputlisting[language=SQL]{../scripts/entities.sql}{SQL script for entities table creation}
\\
\lstinputlisting[language=SQL]{../scripts/relations.sql}{SQL script for relations table creation}

\section*{Design choices \& data constraints}
\problemAnswer{
There are three main concepts in our music database : \textbf{Song}, \textbf{Artist} and \textbf{Album}. Both Song and Album were divided between 
their descriptive data (\textbf{Recording, Release}) and their physical incarnation (\textbf{Track, Medium}). 
Since data is often incomplete, most of the entities 'can be related' but do not have to.
We put a NOT NULL constraint on most of the name attributes of the entities, with the exception of \textbf{Recording} for the reason just stated. Since they are not required fields to describe 
music, they should have a valid name when they are in fact used.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{Track} is related to:
    \begin{description}
	\item[Recording: ] A track can be a physical incarnation of a known recording.
      \item[Artist: ] A track can exist without known artists, but can also have several artists to describe collaborations.
      \item[Medium: ] A track can be recorded on some medium. Their relation is characterized by the track position on the medium.
    \end{description}

  \item An \textbf{Artist} is defined by a:
    \begin{description}
      \item[Genre: ] A genre can regroup multiple artists,
      whereas an artist can be difficult to define as catering to a specific genre, or crossing boundaries between genres nullifying the need for a constraint. We kept the count attribute, 
      choosing small update costs over on-demand higher computation costs. 
      \item[Area: ] An artist's location can be pinpointed to a specific creation grounds, hence can be expressed by a foreign key constraint. But several artists can be compelled 
      to share their musical feelings in the same studio.
    \end{description} 

  \item A \textbf{Release} is the logical aggregation of songs, labeled by a title, and can be recorded on multiple mediums. 
  Conversely, a medium identifies a singular recording of an album, enforced by a foreign key constraint.
\end{itemize}

The integrity of the count attribute in \textbf{Genre}, are not guaranteed by the table creation. It will
later be enforced later on by the import and delete data commands.

}

\section*{Design changes from deliverable 1}
We removed all of our 'at least one' constraints to facilitate the import of new data. For the same reason, we also changed our model to be closer to the given data, so that 
one can easily add any information into the database and not just track-related information like we initially had in mind. That is, in our first model, everything 
had to be related to a track to be relevant but now every entities are independent. 

\section*{Data import }
After having quite a lot of trouble trying to import the data on the oracle server, we decided to use a local database
instead. We used SQLite to handle this database.


\section*{Interface}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We chose to use Python to design the software with the SQLAlchemy API to interface with the database. 
Therefore we used PyQt5 to design the GUI itself providing clean and practical tools. 
SQLAlchemy offers a very useful model as it reflects accurately the actual database schema and makes it easier to map the data to the Model/View offered by Qt.

Our interface allows the user to write their own queries, while providing them with friendly ways to build simple queries to navigate through the database, to edit or delete records and 
to add new ones. The above picture shows our interface, after loading and running query C.
The permissions and access to the different elements of the functionnality is handled through modes. Though we did not have the
time to do it, this could easily be associated with user permissions. We have four different modes, which are a cross product
between table view (tables' columns as in database) or custom view, and read/write or write only.
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 : The upper tool bar offers most of the available functions to create and run queries. From left to right we have the mode selection, the table selection, 
the buttons to run the current query, to search for keywords in the current results and to add a new record to the current table (only in table view) and lastly
the list of the loadable existing queries. A pending query can be canceled by clicking 
a second time on the run button. 
\item 2 : The query is displayed in a text box. It can only be edited in custom mode. 
\item 3 : The results of the last query are shown in a table. 
\item 4 : The navigation tool bar allows user to switch between result pages.
\item 5 : The status bar gives feedback about the queries' runs. On the left, the status (ready or query pending) is given. On the right, if the last request was successful, 
how many results it found and its run time. 
\end{itemize}
Right click on the table provides a contextual menu where the user can choose to edit or delete the selected
entries (in view mode) or to make some follow up queries depending on the selected field. So for instance if we select 
Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Metallica in our table and right click, we can then show all releases featuring those artists.

The update, search and insert queries are handled by pop up dialogs, providing tables to be filled which are then turned into queries. For instance, we can add a new artist.

\section*{Queries \& performance analysis}
As we had chosen to work using Oracle DB our queries were first written using this dialect. Due to issues related to the heavy concurrent usage of the server we later elected to transfer to a local database built using SQLite. However failure to communicate, and an improvable work distribution lead to gaps in the translation to SQLite. We therefore present in this report both versions of the queries.

\subsection*{Run Time}
We display here the run times in seconds for each query, as given to us by the sqlite timer function. Real time corresponds to the time elapsed from start to end of the query, while user and system times correspond to CPU time spend respectively in user and kernel mode. The execution time of the query on the CPU would then equal the sum of both these terms.

\subsection*{On the necessity of indexes}
We chose queries I, K and M for our analysis.
